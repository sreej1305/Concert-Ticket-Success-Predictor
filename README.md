# Concert Ticket Success Predictor

## Project Overview
This project involves building a **time-aware machine learning model** to predict ticket booking success probability for high-demand events. It explicitly models the challenging dynamics of ticket sales, incorporating demand intensity, supply constraints, and booking time decay to mitigate the uncertainty of securing tickets.

## Key Features
- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: developed a model to estimate success rates based on fluctuating demand and limited supply.
- **Time-Decay Modeling**: real-time availability decay is modeled using demand-aware temporal features, capturing how success probability drops as time passes.
- **Analytical Visualizations**: outcomes and insights are presented using detailed 2D and 3D analytical plots to visualize the relationship between time, demand, and success probability.

## Approach
The system uses a generalized prediction framework applicable to concerts or other high-demand events. By analyzing the interplay between:
- **Demand Intensity**
- **Supply Constraints**
- **Booking Time**

The model generates actionable probabilities, helping users understand the optimal timing and conditions for successful booking.
